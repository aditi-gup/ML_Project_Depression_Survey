- **Type**: Survey data with demographic, behavioral, and lifestyle features
- **Target**: Depression (Yes/No)

## 🧪 Algorithms Compared
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest   
- XGBoost 
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📓 Platform
- Google Colab

## 🔧 Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn
